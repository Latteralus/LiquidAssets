# Database Implementation Plan

## Current Status

The implementation of SQLite integration into the game is in progress. Here's the current status:

### Completed Tasks:
1. âœ… Created database folder structure at `/js/database`
2. âœ… Created initial database schema design 
3. âœ… Set up database connection manager with connection pooling
4. âœ… Implemented migration system for schema updates
5. âœ… Created VenueDAO for venue data operations
6. âœ… Created StaffDAO for staff operations
7. âœ… Created CustomerDAO for customer tracking
8. âœ… Created TransactionDAO for financial operations
9. âœ… Created InventoryDAO for inventory management
10. âœ… Created SettingsDAO for game settings
11. âœ… Created service layer (VenueService, GameService)
12. âœ… Created centralized database API
13. âœ… Updated **js/game.js** with database integration
14. âœ… Updated **js/modules/venueManager.js** with database integration

### In Progress:
1. ðŸ”„ Testing database operations for performance and reliability (preliminary testing only, comprehensive test suite planned)
2. ðŸ”„ Refining error handling and recovery procedures for database operations (command processor error handling is complete, but other modules still need work)
3. ðŸ”„ Updating **js/modules/staffManager.js** with database integration
4. ðŸ”„ Integrating NotificationManager with database operations for consistent user feedback

### Remaining Tasks:

#### Core Game Files
1. `js/modules/customerManager.js` - Replace in-memory customer tracking with CustomerDAO
2. `js/modules/cityManager.js` - Create CityDAO and replace city data with database storage
3. `js/modules/eventManager.js` - Update event scheduling to persist in database
4. `js/modules/timeManager.js` - Ensure game time is persisted properly

#### UI Modules
5. `js/ui/uiManager.js` - Update to handle database-driven state updates
6. `js/ui/commandProcessor.js` - Update command handling to use database operations
7. `js/ui/processor/venueCommands.js` - Update to use VenueService
8. `js/ui/processor/staffCommands.js` - Update to use StaffDAO
9. `js/ui/processor/inventoryCommands.js` - Update to use InventoryDAO
10. `js/ui/processor/financeCommands.js` - Update to use TransactionDAO
11. `js/ui/processor/gameCommands.js` - Update save/load to use GameService

## Code Organization & File Size Constraints

All modules must adhere to the following constraints:

1. **Maximum file size: 700 lines of code**
   - If a module exceeds 700 lines, it must be broken down into smaller files in a subdirectory
   - Example: `financialManager.js` can use files in the `/finances/` subdirectory

2. **Modularization principles**
   - Modules should be organized by domain/functionality
   - Each module should have a clear, single responsibility
   - Avoid duplicate code across modules

3. **Priority order**
   - First priority: Keep files under 700 lines by using appropriate subdirectories
   - Second priority: Reduce space by eliminating redundant files and optimizing code

## File Consolidation and Optimization Progress

### Completed Optimizations
1. **InventoryManager**
   - Successfully restructured into a modular system with:
     - `inventoryManager.js` (main coordinator)
     - `inventory/inventoryGenerator.js` (default inventory creation)
     - `inventory/inventoryOperations.js` (CRUD operations)
   - Added new functionality (equipment repair and upgrades)
   - Implemented proper database integration with fallbacks
   - Eliminated redundancy between modules
   - Each file is under 700 lines as required

### Redundancy Reduction Strategy
1. **Venue Management**
   - Keep `venueCreator.js` and `venueUpgrader.js` but optimize them to only contain code not covered by the VenueService
   - Remove any duplicate code that now exists in the database layer

2. **Financial Management**
   - Keep the `/finances/` subdirectory but optimize each file:
     - `expenseManager.js`: Focus only on expense calculations and categorization
     - `revenueManager.js`: Focus only on revenue calculations and categorization
     - `reportingManager.js`: Focus only on report formatting and processing
     - `transactionManager.js`: Replace most functionality with TransactionDAO

3. **Customer Management**
   - Keep the `/customer/` subdirectory but optimize each file:
     - `customerGenerator.js`: Optimize to focus only on customer attribute generation
     - `customerBehavior.js`: Focus on behavior logic, not data storage
     - `customerOrders.js`: Optimize order processing logic
     - `customerSatisfaction.js`: Maintain satisfaction calculations

### Code Optimization Strategies
1. **Remove redundant validation code**
   - Move validation to the DAO layer where possible
   - Eliminate duplicate validation across files

2. **Simplify functions**
   - Reduce function complexity by leveraging database queries
   - Replace multi-step processes with single database calls where appropriate

3. **Eliminate caching/storage duplication**
   - Remove code that duplicates database storage functionality
   - Replace in-memory caches with database queries where appropriate

4. **Clean up unused/deprecated code**
   - Identify and remove unused functions and variables
   - Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed

## Implementation Approach

To ensure we maintain functionality while optimizing:

1. **Module-by-Module Updates**
   - Update one manager at a time to use the database
   - Test thoroughly after each update
   - Keep file size under 700 lines

2. **Database-Centric Functionality**
   - Wherever possible, switch managers to use database-only operations
   - Only retain in-memory capabilities if absolutely necessary for performance reasons
   - If a feature flag (useDatabase) is required, ensure it's only used for critical fallback situations

3. **Gradual Optimization**
   - First, make the module work with the database
   - Then optimize to remove redundancy
   - Finally, refactor to optimize file size and code quality

4. **Code Review Process**
   - After each module update, review for redundancy
   - Check file sizes and modularize if needed
   - Ensure all imports/exports are properly updated

## Addressing Architectural Challenges

### Circular Dependencies Resolution
To address the issue of circular dependencies between modules, the database layer will help by:

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
   - Implementing a true service layer that handles complex operations
   - Moving business logic from managers to appropriate services
   - Using dependency injection for services instead of direct imports

2. **Event-Based Communication**
   - Implementing a publish/subscribe pattern for cross-module communication
   - Leveraging database triggers for certain automatic actions
   - Reducing direct module-to-module function calls

3. **Data Access Abstraction**
   - Creating a clear separation between data access and business logic
   - Using the DAO pattern consistently across all modules
   - Implementing query objects to encapsulate complex database operations

4. **Data Flow Directionality**
   - Establishing a clear unidirectional data flow
   - Managers request data from services, not directly from other managers
   - Services coordinate complex operations involving multiple DAOs

### NotificationManager Integration
To properly integrate the NotificationManager with database operations:

1. **Database Event Notifications**
   - Implement database triggers or observers for significant state changes
   - Connect these observers to the NotificationManager to generate user notifications
   - Categorize database events by severity and relevance for appropriate notification types

2. **Transaction Feedback**
   - Provide detailed success/failure feedback for database operations
   - Use NotificationManager to convey transaction results to the user
   - Include transaction IDs in notifications for troubleshooting

3. **Data Validation Feedback**
   - Channel database constraint violation errors through NotificationManager
   - Translate technical database errors into user-friendly notifications
   - Group related validation errors into a single notification when appropriate

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

1. Complete `staffManager.js` integration with StaffDAO
   - Follow the same modular approach used for InventoryManager
   - Consider breaking into specialized submodules if needed

2. Update `customerManager.js` to use CustomerDAO
   - Review existing customer modules for optimization opportunities
   - Ensure no single file exceeds 700 lines

3. Create CityDAO and update `cityManager.js` to use database storage
   - Implement proper data structure for city-specific regulations and properties
   - Focus on keeping code modular and maintainable

4. Begin optimizing venue-related files to remove redundancy
   - Maintain functionality while reducing code duplication
   - Keep all files under 700 lines
