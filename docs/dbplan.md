3. âœ… Set up database connection manager with connection pooling
4. âœ… Implemented migration system for schema updates
5. âœ… Created VenueDAO for venue data operations
6. âœ… Created StaffDAO for staff operations
7. âœ… Created CustomerDAO for customer tracking
8. âœ… Created TransactionDAO for financial operations
9. âœ… Created InventoryDAO for inventory management
10. âœ… Created SettingsDAO for game settings
11. âœ… Created service layer (VenueService, GameService)
12. âœ… Created centralized database API
13. âœ… Updated **js/game.js** with database integration
14. âœ… Updated **js/modules/venueManager.js** with database integration

### In Progress:
1. ðŸ”„ Testing database operations for performance and reliability
2. ðŸ”„ Refining error handling and recovery procedures

### Remaining Tasks:

#### Core Game Files
1. `js/modules/staffManager.js` - Replace direct state manipulation with StaffDAO
2. `js/modules/customerManager.js` - Replace in-memory customer tracking with CustomerDAO
3. `js/modules/financialManager.js` - Replace direct financial tracking with TransactionDAO
4. `js/modules/inventoryManager.js` - Replace inventory management with InventoryDAO
5. `js/modules/cityManager.js` - Replace city data with potential CityDAO (may need to be created)
6. `js/modules/eventManager.js` - Update event scheduling to persist in database
7. `js/modules/timeManager.js` - Ensure game time is persisted properly

#### UI Modules
8. `js/ui/uiManager.js` - Update to handle database-driven state updates
9. `js/ui/commandProcessor.js` - Update command handling to use database operations
10. `js/ui/processor/venueCommands.js` - Update to use VenueService
11. `js/ui/processor/staffCommands.js` - Update to use StaffDAO
12. `js/ui/processor/inventoryCommands.js` - Update to use InventoryDAO
13. `js/ui/processor/financeCommands.js` - Update to use TransactionDAO
14. `js/ui/processor/gameCommands.js` - Update save/load to use GameService

## Code Organization & File Size Constraints

All modules must adhere to the following constraints:

1. **Maximum file size: 700 lines of code**
   - If a module exceeds 700 lines, it must be broken down into smaller files in a subdirectory
   - Example: `financialManager.js` can use files in the `/finances/` subdirectory

2. **Modularization principles**
   - Modules should be organized by domain/functionality
   - Each module should have a clear, single responsibility
   - Avoid duplicate code across modules

3. **Priority order**
   - First priority: Keep files under 700 lines by using appropriate subdirectories
   - Second priority: Reduce space by eliminating redundant files and optimizing code

## File Consolidation and Optimization Plan

To optimize our codebase while respecting the 700-line constraint, we'll follow this approach:

### Files to Eliminate
1. **`js/utils/dataStore.js`** - Completely replace with database storage

### Redundancy Reduction Strategy
1. **Venue Management**
   - Keep `venueCreator.js` and `venueUpgrader.js` but optimize them to only contain code not covered by the VenueService
   - Remove any duplicate code that now exists in the database layer

2. **Financial Management**
   - Keep the `/finances/` subdirectory but optimize each file:
     - `expenseManager.js`: Focus only on expense calculations and categorization
     - `revenueManager.js`: Focus only on revenue calculations and categorization
     - `reportingManager.js`: Focus only on report formatting and processing
     - `transactionManager.js`: Replace most functionality with TransactionDAO

3. **Customer Management**
   - Keep the `/customer/` subdirectory but optimize each file:
     - `customerGenerator.js`: Optimize to focus only on customer attribute generation
     - `customerBehavior.js`: Focus on behavior logic, not data storage
     - `customerOrders.js`: Optimize order processing logic
     - `customerSatisfaction.js`: Maintain satisfaction calculations

### Code Optimization Strategies
1. **Remove redundant validation code**
   - Move validation to the DAO layer where possible
   - Eliminate duplicate validation across files

2. **Simplify functions**
   - Reduce function complexity by leveraging database queries
   - Replace multi-step processes with single database calls where appropriate

3. **Eliminate caching/storage duplication**
   - Remove code that duplicates database storage functionality
   - Replace in-memory caches with database queries where appropriate

4. **Clean up unused/deprecated code**
   - Identify and remove unused functions and variables
   - Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed

## Implementation Approach

To ensure we maintain functionality while optimizing:

1. **Module-by-Module Updates**
   - Update one manager at a time to use the database
   - Test thoroughly after each update
   - Keep file size under 700 lines

2. **Hybrid Functionality**
   - Each manager should maintain both database and in-memory capabilities
   - Use a feature flag (`useDatabase`) to toggle between modes
   - Ensure backward compatibility during transition

3. **Gradual Optimization**
   - First, make the module work with the database
   - Then optimize to remove redundancy
   - Finally, refactor to optimize file size and code quality

4. **Code Review Process**
   - After each module update, review for redundancy
   - Check file sizes and modularize if needed
   - Ensure all imports/exports are properly updated

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

1. Update `staffManager.js` to use StaffDAO
   - Ensure it stays under 700 lines
   - Optimize any redundant code

2. Update `financialManager.js` to use TransactionDAO
   - Optimize `/finances/` subdirectory files
   - Ensure no single file exceeds 700 lines

3. Update `inventoryManager.js` to use InventoryDAO
   - Optimize inventory management logic
   - Focus on keeping file size manageable

4. Begin optimizing venue-related files to remove redundancy
   - Maintain functionality while reducing code duplication
   - Keep all files under 700 lines
