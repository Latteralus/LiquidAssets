# Database Implementation Plan

## Current Status

The implementation of SQLite integration into the game is in progress. Here's the current status:

### Completed Tasks:
1. âœ… Created database folder structure at `/js/database`
2. âœ… Created initial database schema design 
3. âœ… Set up database connection manager with connection pooling
4. âœ… Implemented migration system for schema updates
5. âœ… Created VenueDAO for venue data operations
6. âœ… Created StaffDAO for staff operations
7. âœ… Created CustomerDAO for customer tracking
8. âœ… Created TransactionDAO for financial operations
9. âœ… Created InventoryDAO for inventory management
10. âœ… Created SettingsDAO for game settings
11. âœ… Created service layer (VenueService, GameService)
12. âœ… Created centralized database API
13. âœ… Updated **js/game.js** with database integration

### In Progress:
1. ðŸ”„ Testing database operations for performance and reliability
2. ðŸ”„ Refining error handling and recovery procedures

### Remaining Tasks:

#### Core Game Files
1. `js/modules/venueManager.js` - Replace direct state manipulation with VenueDAO/VenueService
2. `js/modules/staffManager.js` - Replace direct state manipulation with StaffDAO
3. `js/modules/customerManager.js` - Replace in-memory customer tracking with CustomerDAO
4. `js/modules/financialManager.js` - Replace direct financial tracking with TransactionDAO
5. `js/modules/inventoryManager.js` - Replace inventory management with InventoryDAO
6. `js/modules/cityManager.js` - Replace city data with potential CityDAO (may need to be created)
7. `js/modules/eventManager.js` - Update event scheduling to persist in database
8. `js/modules/timeManager.js` - Ensure game time is persisted properly

#### UI Modules
9. `js/ui/uiManager.js` - Update to handle database-driven state updates
10. `js/ui/commandProcessor.js` - Update command handling to use database operations
11. `js/ui/processor/venueCommands.js` - Update to use VenueService
12. `js/ui/processor/staffCommands.js` - Update to use StaffDAO
13. `js/ui/processor/inventoryCommands.js` - Update to use InventoryDAO
14. `js/ui/processor/financeCommands.js` - Update to use TransactionDAO
15. `js/ui/processor/gameCommands.js` - Update save/load to use GameService

#### System Integration
16. Implement query caching for performance-critical operations
17. Add comprehensive error handling for database operations
18. Create database backup and restore functionality
19. Create migration tool for existing save files
20. Update documentation for database features

## Implementation Strategy

To complete the remaining tasks, we'll follow this approach:

1. **Prioritize Core Managers First**: Start with the most fundamental managers (venueManager, staffManager) and gradually work up the dependency chain.

2. **Create Backward Compatibility**: Ensure each updated module can still function with in-memory storage if the database isn't available.

3. **Incremental Updates**: Update one module at a time, ensuring it's fully functional before moving to the next one.

4. **Testing Focus**: After each module update, test thoroughly to identify any issues early in the process.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Add query caching and optimization after basic functionality is working.

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

1. Update `venueManager.js` to use VenueService/VenueDAO
2. Update `staffManager.js` to use StaffDAO
3. Update `financialManager.js` to use TransactionDAO
4. Implement database-backed command processors

Once these core systems are updated, we'll focus on the remaining modules in the order of their dependencies.
