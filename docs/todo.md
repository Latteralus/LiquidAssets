# Project Status: Liquid Assets Game

## Key Issues

### 1. Code Organization Issues

1. **Duplicate File in Structure**: ✅ FIXED - The duplicate `menuManager.js` entry has been removed from filestructure.md.

2. **Inconsistent Module Loading**: ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED - Some files now properly use CommonJS (`require()`) for imports consistently, but there are still modules that assume global availability of other modules.
   - Most core modules now properly use `require()` but UI interactions sometimes assume global availability of game objects
   - Example: Some modules still assume `window.logToConsole` exists globally, though we've created a migration path with the new NotificationManager

3. **Circular Dependencies**: ⚠️ ONGOING - The architecture still creates potential circular dependencies between modules.
   - The Game class and Manager classes have bidirectional dependencies
   - Need to consider implementing a proper dependency injection system or event bus

### 2. Technical Implementation Issues

1. **Window Object Access in Node.js Context**: ✅ FIXED - The `dataStore.js` has been updated to use Node.js file system operations instead of `window.localStorage`.

2. **Inconsistent API Usage**: ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Implemented a structured notification system with NotificationManager to replace direct DOM manipulation
   - Created clear migration path with backwards compatibility for modules to transition from window.logToConsole
   - Still need to update modules to use the new notification system

3. **Broken IPC Communication**: ✅ FIXED
   - The IPC implementation between renderer and main processes has been fixed
   - Added proper handling for save/load operations
   - Improved game loop synchronization across process boundaries
   - Added exit confirmation handling

4. **Missing Error Handling**: ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
   - Added comprehensive error handling to all command processors
   - Implemented consistent validation across all commands
   - Added detailed error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
   - Still need to improve error handling in remaining modules, especially for async operations

### 3. Game Logic Issues

1. **Time Management Inconsistencies**: ✅ FIXED
   - Game loop now properly handles time progression with configurable speed
   - Added proper cleanup on app shutdown

   - Customer satisfaction is affected by multiple factors including service quality and venue atmosphere
   - Some refinements still needed in group dynamics and preference handling

3. **Financial Calculation Simplifications**: ⚠️ ONGOING
   - Financial calculations still use simplified assumptions
   - Need more realistic modeling of expenses, taxes, seasonal variations

4. **Static City Regulations**: ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
   - City regulations don't evolve over time
   - Should implement events that change regulations periodically

### 4. UI/UX Issues

### 6. Architectural Issues

1. **Large Monolithic Files**: ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
   - `commandProcessor.js` has been refactored into specialized modules
   - `venueManager.js` has been broken down into smaller, focused modules
   - `renderEngine.js` has been modularized into a well-structured system
   - `customerManager.js` uses an appropriate modular approach with sub-modules
   - Need to review remaining large files for possible refactoring

2. **Mixed Responsibilities**: ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Command processors now have clear single responsibilities
   - NotificationManager provides clear separation between business logic and UI updates for notifications
   - The new rendering system properly separates concerns with dedicated modules
   - CustomerManager has clear separation between different customer aspects
   - Some modules still handle both business logic and UI updates

3. **State Management Complexity**: ⚠️ ONGOING
   - Game state is distributed across multiple managers rather than using a centralized approach
   - Consider implementing a more structured state management pattern

4. **Missing Unit Tests**: ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
   - The codebase still lacks tests for critical game logic
   - Need to implement testing framework and core tests
