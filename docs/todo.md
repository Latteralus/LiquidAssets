# Project Status: Liquid Assets Game

## Key Issues

### 1. Code Organization Issues

1. **Duplicate File in Structure**: ✅ FIXED - The duplicate `menuManager.js` entry has been removed from filestructure.md.

2. **Inconsistent Module Loading**: ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED - Some files now properly use CommonJS (`require()`) for imports consistently, but there are still modules that assume global availability of other modules.
   - Most core modules now properly use `require()` but UI interactions sometimes assume global availability of game objects
   - Example: Some modules still assume `window.logToConsole` exists globally, though we've created a migration path with the new NotificationManager

3. **Circular Dependencies**: ⚠️ ONGOING - The architecture still creates potential circular dependencies between modules.
   - The Game class and Manager classes have bidirectional dependencies
   - Need to implement service-oriented architecture and event-based communication as outlined in the database implementation plan

### 2. Technical Implementation Issues

1. **Window Object Access in Node.js Context**: ✅ FIXED - The `dataStore.js` has been updated to use Node.js file system operations instead of `window.localStorage`.

2. **Inconsistent API Usage**: ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Implemented a structured notification system with NotificationManager to replace direct DOM manipulation
   - Created clear migration path with backwards compatibility for modules to transition from window.logToConsole
   - Still need to update modules to use the new notification system

3. **Broken IPC Communication**: ✅ FIXED
   - The IPC implementation between renderer and main processes has been fixed
   - Added proper handling for save/load operations
   - Improved game loop synchronization across process boundaries
   - Added exit confirmation handling

4. **Missing Error Handling**: ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
   - Added comprehensive error handling to all command processors
   - Implemented consistent validation across all commands
   - Added detailed error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
   - Still need to improve error handling in remaining modules, especially for async operations

### 3. Game Logic Issues

1. **Time Management Inconsistencies**: ✅ FIXED
   - Game loop now properly handles time progression with configurable speed
   - Added proper cleanup on app shutdown
   - Implemented pause/resume functionality
   - Added adequate memory management with optional garbage collection

2. **Incomplete Customer Behavior Logic**: ✅ MOSTLY FIXED
   - Customer manager has good modular structure with dedicated sub-modules
   - Customer generation properly accounts for venue type, time of day, and city demographics
   - Customer behavior cycle (entering, seated, ordering, etc.) is well implemented
   - Customer satisfaction is affected by multiple factors including service quality and venue atmosphere
   - Some refinements still needed in group dynamics and preference handling

3. **Financial Calculation Simplifications**: ⚠️ ONGOING
   - Financial calculations still use simplified assumptions
   - Need more realistic modeling of expenses, taxes, seasonal variations

4. **Static City Regulations**: ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
   - City regulations don't evolve over time
   - Should implement events that change regulations periodically

5. **Name Generation System**: ✅ FIXED
   - Implemented comprehensive name generation system
   - Created modular structure with specialized name lists
   - Added support for different name types (people, venues, foods, drinks, events)
   - Added culturally diverse names for international flavor

### 4. UI/UX Issues

1. **Over-Reliance on Console Logs**: ✅ FIXED
   - Implemented comprehensive notification system (NotificationManager)
   - Added categorized, filterable notifications with rich metadata
   - Provided clear migration path for modules to transition from window.logToConsole
   - Added detailed notification view with related notifications linking

2. **Incomplete Rendering System**: ✅ FIXED
   - Implemented a comprehensive modular rendering system
   - Created venue visualization with dynamic elements based on venue type
   - Added support for interactive elements with hover and selection
   - Implemented animation system for smooth entity movement
   - Added ambient effects for atmosphere like lighting and music visualization

3. **Limited UI Feedback**: ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
   - Implemented consistent feedback mechanisms in command processors
   - Added contextual hints and suggestions based on command results
   - Improved error messages with specific guidance
   - Used appropriate notification types (info, success, warning, error) consistently
